cards-against-gmod

Cards against GMod is a chat-based version of Cards Against Humanity for GMOD.  This allows players to play CaH (or, rather, CaG) while in-game.  No docs yet, but the majority of the code is in sv_cag1.lua and is a pretty easy read.  You can also say "!cag help" in game for in-game docs.

The questions and answers are, of course, directly from CaH (and covered under their Creative Commons license).  Anyone who isn't familiar with CaH, be warned -- they can get quite vulgar.  Sense of humor needed.  :)
